Angular Technical Challenge

Set up an angular material (https://material.angular.io/) project to provide CRUD functionality for widgets. Widgets should have an id, title, date, price and description. There should be separate routes for the list and detail pages. 


The list page should utilize an angular material data table with a local datasource. It should be sortable, searchable, paginated, and contain links to a detail page for each widget. The detail page should use appropriate angular material components (e.g. date selectors for the date field).


Bonus challenges: 


add a core service for the app to notify users that a widget has been created, updated or deleted.

incorporate a rich text editor for the widget description field.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
